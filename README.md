Create a random password generator where a user can select:
The length of the password
If they want to include uppercase
If they want to include special characters.

Includes alerts if the user inputs data outside of the specified parameters.

HTML, CSS & JS starting code has been provided and I have worked solely on the JS to make the password generator.
