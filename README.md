Create a random password generator where a user can select:
The length of the password
If they want to include uppercase
If they want to include special characters
If they want to lower uppercase
If they want to include numbers

Includes alerts if the user inputs:
An number less than 8 or greater than 128
String instead of a number
Doesn't select any inputs at all

HTML, CSS & JS starting code has been provided and I have worked solely on the JS to make the password generator work.
